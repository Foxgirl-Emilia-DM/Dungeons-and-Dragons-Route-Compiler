Download the associated [.zip file](https://github.com/Foxgirl-Emilia-DM/Dungeons-and-Dragons-Route-Compiler/blob/master/Dungeons%20and%20Dragons%20Route%20Compiler/Dungeons-and-Dragons-Route-Compiler.zip) to run the program.

This is the only file you need to download.

Unzip the file, and run the .exe to use the program.

Assuming your DM has provided you with a map, you can use this to work out distances and routes for your party.

If you're a different DM to me that wants to use this, unfortunately this does not support multiple DMs, just me.
Request or get in contact with me on discord if you need anything so you can create your own version.
Have a great journey!
